1. #### Kids Room 3D Scene

**Scene File:** `2\_KidsRoom\_3D\_Scene.unity`



##### Summary:

I explored Unity's 3D capabilities by designing a child's bedroom with interactive and dynamic elements. I developed hands-on skills in 3D navigation, object customization, prefab creation, lighting setup, and basic physics implementation.



##### What I Did:

* Built a precise block tower using vertex snapping
* Designed a custom play area with shaped prefabs for a bouncing ball
* Framed and positioned my own custom artwork
* Captured the scene using an in-game camera



##### Screenshot:

#### 2\. Kitchen Audio Scene

**Scene File:** `3\_Kitchen\_Audio\_Scene.unity`



##### Summary:

I implemented multiple types of audio into a kitchen-themed scene to create atmosphere and immersion. This included background music, spatial audio sources, and reverb zones.



##### What I Did:

* Added a humming sound to the refrigerator for realism
* Sourced and integrated custom background music
* Experimented with Unity's reverb zones to simulate room acoustics
